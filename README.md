# Qutrunk
Qutrunk is a managed queue-as-a-service. Using the simple REST API, you push and pull messages without worrying about queue reliability. Qutrunk supports multiple backends as well as access control using access tokens and statistics, all via the web interface. [Read more about architecture in docs](https://github.com/spinache/qutrunk-api/wiki)

# Features

* PUSH and PULL messages with simple GET & POST
* Manage queues from web GUI

* Multiple backends (currently MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis)
* Multiple ingestion/digestion protocols (currently HTTP(S), gRPC)
* Queue usage statistics and aditing (message log)

# Running
We recommend starting at least two Node.js processes that listen to HTTP requests.
You can setup a reverse proxy like Nginx in front of those processes that will also handle SSL handshakes. For more details refer to [docs](https://github.com/spinache/qutrunk-api/wiki).
